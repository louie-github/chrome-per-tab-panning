// I have to export SCSS variables through a separate scss file so I
// can reference the original in the HTML markup while also exposing
// variables to JavaScript through here.

@import "popup";

// This seems rather hard to find in the css-modules documentation;
// you have to look through icss (https://github.com/css-modules/icss),
// the low-level file format, to explain what :export does.
// Anyway, this exports CSS values as variables for JS interoperability.
:export {
  colorSliderLeft: $color-slider-left;
  colorSliderRight: $color-slider-right;
}
