Thanks to [piousdeer](https://github.com/piousdeer/chrome-volume-manager)
for nearly all of the code written in this repository. Only minor
changes have been made.

# Usage
This extension is not published in the Chrome Web Store as it is in
development and is mainly an **academic exercise**; you have to build
it yourself.

## Steps:
1. Clone this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/louie-github/chrome-per-tab-panning.git`
2. Run `npm install && npm run build`
3. Go to `chrome://extensions/`, enable Developer Mode, click on
   "Load unpacked", and select the `dist` folder.
